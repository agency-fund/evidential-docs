# Experiment Config Construction Overview

An experiment config is comprised of the following primary components:

1. A DesignSpec specifying:
   1. the treatment arms
   1. the type of participant you are experimenting on
   1. filters targeting the subset of participants eligible
   1. outcome metrics
   1. strata
   1. experiment meta data (start/end date, name, description)
   1. statistical parameters (power, significance, balance test threshold)
1. Power calculations for the outcome metrics
1. An Assignment for each sampled participant given the DesignSpec.

For generating 3 and 4 above, we perform:

1. Baseline data retrieval - mean, stddev (for numeric metrics), and the number of available
   participants targeted by the filters
1. Power analysis - Given the DesignSpec we analyze the statistical power for each metric in the
   DesignSpec, along with the statistical parameters. This occurs as follows for each metric:
   1. If there is no baseline value (and std dev for numeric metrics), go to the
      data source to fetch these values.
   1. Use the declared metric_target or compute this target based on
      metric_pct_change and the baseline value.
   1. Use the number of arms, metric baseline and target, statistical parameters
      and the number of participants available using the Audience filter to determine
      if we're sufficiently powered. If we are not, compute the effect size needed to
      be powered. This power information can be added to the metrics in the DesignSpec.
1. Assignment - the Power analysis computes the minimum number of participants needed
   to be statistically powered "n" which is left to the user to supply for assignment.
   AssignRequest takes the same inputs (DesignSpec) to generate a list of "n" users randomly
   assigned using the set of treatment arms and the strata. This
   should return a list of objects containing a participant id, treatment assignment,
   and strata values.
1. Analysis - TBD
